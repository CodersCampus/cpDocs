## Before Getting Set-Up
1. Ensure you have **Java JDK 17** in your IDE. If you don't, the **cp** app will not run. 
2. Eclipse IDE users need **Eclipse 2021-09 (4.21)** or later. If you don't, please install a newer version.


## 1. Starting cp

### GitHub
1. Be given access to contribute too https://github.com/CodersCampus/cp, private repository via (Pete).
2. Click on green `<> Clone` button.
3. Click `Open with GitHub Desktop`.
4. Browser will display pop up window `Open GitHub Desktop.app?`.
5. Click `Open GitHub Desktop.app` button.

### GitHub Dektop
6. In GitHub Desktop, **Clone a Repository** window opens to the **URL** tab.
7. Keep the _**Repository URL or GitHub username and repository**_ field as is.
8. You can keep the _**Local Path**_ as is or change it by pressing the `Choose` button and selecting a different location in Finder/Explorer to store the cp repository.
9. Next, click blue `Clone` button.
10. **Current Repository** should be `cp`, **Current Branch** should be `dev`, and you'll have the option to `Fetch origin`.

### Eclipse IDE
14. Eclipse will open and give you the prompt window "**Import Projects from File System or Archive**".
15. In the "**Import Source**" field, that should be left alone, as that's where you choose to store the **cp** repository, earlier in GitHub Desktop.
16. Click bottom right button `Finish`.
17. You may see "**Import as Maven project**", if you do, select **Maven**, as this is how you need to import this project.
18. **cp** should populate within the **Project Explorer** side panel of **Eclipse IDE**.

### Run cp
19. To run **cp** application you will traverse through the **cp** folder structure clicking the dropdown arrows as you go.
  - That path is, cp/src/main/java/com.coderscampus/SpringWiseApplication.java. 
  - Open SpringWiseApplication.java
  - Press the green `Run` button to run application or right click on main method of SpringWiseApplication.java, and select `Run As` > `Java Application`.
20. You should see the Spring Boot design in the console with a bunch of other content.

21. Now navigate to browser of choice, we use Chrome, and type into the address bar `localhost:8080`, this is the local address the **cp** application is being served too.
22. **cp** application should be live on your browser.
23. If prompted to **Login**, then login to the application using a Gmail account.
