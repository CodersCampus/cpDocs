# Coders Packaging Leadership Basics

Leadership, in this context, defines which people have volunteered to function as the servants of other students, within the project. 

Thus, Leadership, here is a fancy word for an age old concept of [servant/leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership).

## The Basic Function of This Project

Our job as leader is to help others with the main reasons they are here in the first place:

1. Curiosity about what my new job's dev workflow will look like
2. Desire to perform well on interviews and get a job
3. A more enjoyable/social way to get my coding reps in
4. Maximize learning by watching others do the dev workflow in real time

## Leadership Priorities

Not necessarily in order

- Predictable Schedule!
- How To, on WorkFlow
- Technical Leadership
- Live Coding
- Feeling Welcome

If 90% of success is showing up, then 90% of the job of the leader is making sure that everyone who wants to participate knows which checkins to show up for, and what will be happening at each! Yup!

People plan their lives around their priorities. If you want to help people, let them know days in advance which checkins will be SpringWise checkins.

Want to go one step further? Canvas participants regularly, and figure out the best schedules to set!

Not all leaders will serve this function, other leaders provide training, or technical leadership, high speed coding, or even just encouragement. Whatever it takes. This is what servant-leaders do.

## Succession

Our job is to graduate! That means we need to always have a succession plan for every leader.

- Longer term workflow leaders (starting a6)
- Shorter term technical leaders (starting a10)

Ideally, we are always recruiting for our replacement, because we hope to graduate and get a job as quickly as possible.
