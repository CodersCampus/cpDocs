# Land Your 1st Dev Job

## **Overview**

This guide outlines a structured approach for developers to effectively reach out to potential employers. It's designed to maximize job contact success by systematically targeting and following up with companies.

## **Daily Breakdown**

### **Day 1: Research and List Creation**

1. **Identify 100 Companies**: Focus on finding companies that interest you.

2. **Use Job Posting Sites**: Utilize sites like [Indeed.com](http://Indeed.com) to find remote Java or Full Stack Java positions in the USA or your preferred country.

3. **Gather Contact Information**: Compile contact details of these companies. Prioritize getting contact names, but it's okay if you can't.

4. **Organize Your List**: Use Excel, Numbers, or Google Sheets to create a list of these companies with their contact information in the following format:

   | Company   | Company Web Page                    | Contact Name   | Contact Email                |
      | --------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
   | Company A | [companyA.com](http://companyA.com) | Contact Person | <mailto:contact@example.com> |
   | Company B | [companyB.com](http://companyB.com) | Contact Person | <mailto:contact@example.com> |

### **Day 2: Email Preparation and Personalization**

1. **Create an Email Template**: Draft a template to market yourself, highlighting your unique skills and value.
2. **Research Companies**: Spend two weeks researching the companies. Gather information about their activities, mission, goals, and impact.
3. **Personalize Your Emails**: Use the research to tailor each email, ensuring a strong, clear, and concise message.
4. **Send Out Emails**: Start contacting the companies with your personalized emails.

## **Follow-up Email Process**

1. **Initial Follow-up Schedule**:

    - Send the first follow-up email after 1 day, then continue with an increasing interval (2 days, 3 days, etc.).
    - Repeat this process until you receive a response. Respect any request to cease contact.

   ```
   **Send first email**
     1. Wait 1 day...then send follow up email
     2. Wait 2 days...then send follow up email
     3. Wait 3 days...then send follow up email
     etc...
   ```

2. **Follow-up Email Content**: Keep follow-up emails brief, expressing your enthusiasm and readiness to discuss further.

### **Example Follow-up Email**

```

**Subject:** Software Engineer Position Application Follow-Up – [Your Full Name]

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well! Just touching base regarding my application for the Software Engineer role sent on [Date]. I’m eager to contribute my [Key Skill/Area] expertise to [Company Name].

Please let me know if you need more information to progress the application.

Best regards,

[Your Full Name]
[Your Email]
[Your Phone Number]
```

1. **Procedure**: Apply this follow-up process to each company, making necessary adjustments to the details in each email.

## **Smaller Scale Approach**

For those preferring a more focused approach:

1. **Select a Smaller Number of Companies**: Choose around 20 companies where you envision a long-term career (5-10 years).
2. **Apply and Follow Up Relentlessly**: Prepare strong applications for these companies and persistently follow up.

**Key Principle**: The fortune is in the follow-up. Consistent and respectful follow-up can significantly increase your chances of success.
