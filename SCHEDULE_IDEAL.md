# Ideal Schedule

What considerations make for an ideal schedule?

## High Level Schedule Concerns:

- _**Easy**_ to catch 2 per week no matter who you are
- _**Pre-announced agenda**_ allows LiveCoders to plan ahead
- _**Predicatable:**_ Students with tight schedules can plan ahead
- _**Consistent**_ Ideally almost same schedule every week
- _**Planned Topic**_ for every meeting, including who presents.

## Resultant Filters:

To make it easy to catch 2 per week, that means 3-4 meetings a week need to be scheduled as SpringWise, because students often cannot make some times.

This pretty much means the most popular 4 times a week:

- Monday 7pm CST
- Tues 12:30pm CST
- Wednesday 7pm CST (Unless co-opted for Final Project presentation)
- Thurs 12:30pm CST

By scheduling each of these 4 times as always #SpringWise, that also satisfies the above high level filters of predictability and consistency

## Planned Task

- _**WHAT**_ task or tasks will be executed.
- _**WHO**_ will prepare to execute - if any.

Not every session has to be planned, but one may notice, on average, that planned sessions go a little bit better due to less fumbling better preparation.

Even something as simple as "Billy will attempt Issue 345" can be a good start towards a plan.

## Weekly Announcements

Where are announcements made?

- _**SpringWise Leads**_ Can and should announce their weekly plans on #springwise channel in slack.
- _**Instructor**_ only should be left to make all schedule announcements on the FullStack channel.

## Tier system for how we run spring wise sessions

- Assignment 13-FP (Tier 1)</br>
 <sub><sup>Advanced students leading live coding in the spectrum of CRUD</sub></sub></br>
<sub><sup> Lower level student does code review</sub></sup></br>
- Assignment 9-11 (Tier 2)</br>
<sub><sup> Live Coding with coaching through simple processes including things, but not limited to simple controllers and html pages </sub></sup></br>
- Assignment 6-8 (Tier 3)</br>
<sub><sup> Simple reps of team work process code reviews involving adding simple files to project and then pushing back up. </sub></sup></br>
