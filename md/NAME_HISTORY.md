# Are we Springwise or `coder packaging` app?

Our early history unfolded as a series of surprises, which has left us with some rather disjointed branding. 

The result is not as interesting as the history itself though. 

## TL;DR version

1. `Springwise` is legacy name and we just use it affectionately to describe our team and our codebase. But it no longer describes our app.
1. `coder packaging` is the current name of our app, and it also describes what our app does.
1. We will probably, eventually, lose the `Springwise` branding.

So that's the short version.

## Student Origins

If you believe that one person cannot change lives, this project proves you wrong. So very many people have stepped up - each making dramatic improvements in how we do what we do.

It has changed the lives of many students to follow them, and in a meaningful way.

## Approximate history:

These are the basic outlines of our history.

#### Before LiveCoding

Before there was a project and LiveCoding there were boring checkins, 2021 and 2022 But that was OK because no one came to checkins anyway ...

Then a vibrant group came along when Dan and Jonny Berkness, David Lobo, and others were struggling in the early assignments, and just wouldn't let go. They pioneered many of the approaches we take for granted now, and in turn taught Coders Campus how the material is more easily learned. 

Then Ethan Bradley suggested that building an app would be a more natural vehicle to learn from, but this idea really took off when Ricardo Altorre singlehandedly built a full stack Cars app as a many session live demo. Other students watched in amazement, and it was a huge success by itself, but languished for months.

#### Springwise was born

Alex Joiner finished the first half of the bootcamp and just decided we should build an app at checkins. He polled others, the consensus was "Springwise" and our effort was born in April 2023.

Phillip Mathews immediately started blasting out templates, introduced bootstrap, and Caleb Hurst followed behind to set some of the original look and feel.

The app had no purpose, but it was often enjoyed in the early days (Trucks, Cars, Ducks, Airplanes, ...) as a place to compete. How much CRUD could you do in one session? Jun Park blew us out of the water one day when he almost got full CRUD views done and working in one session - and he hadn't even finished half the bootcamp!

It was a lot of fun.

#### Leadership Emerges

2023 saw Caleb Hurst and Karen Dillehay take the formal reins in the live coding sessions, as students seemed to enjoy that more than instructor led sessions. 

We gradually made a couple CRUD tools for our own use, the User History still being used to day. This period saw many of our current practices stabilize.

#### `coder packaging app` 

Ducks and Trucks were fun to build but not very satisfying to maintain. Interest in the sessions began to decline. 

Then someone - not even sure who or when but it became suddenly obvious that all students needed an app to help them organize the data that presents themselves to the world that wants to hire them. 

After some fidgeting the term `coder packaging` was arrived at.

- `coder` from Coders Campus
- `packaging` from David Roberts teachings.

This was in the summer/fall of 2023. 

Our github repository was still named 'Springwise' as was our slack channel. So there is some leftover branding that we haven't resolved yet.

## Going Forward

At one point we will have to probably resolve the branding conflict.

But the `springwise` name may diminish eventually. And `coder packaging` would replace it. 

But that would be an organic process and probably take months, most noticeably after the app itself begins to take on some recognizeable branding, on it's own merit.
